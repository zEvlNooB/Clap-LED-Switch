LED Clap Switch
This project allows you to control an LED using a clap sound. The system uses a sound sensor to detect the sound of a clap, which then triggers the Arduino to turn the LED on or off. It‚Äôs a fun and interactive project to demonstrate how sound can control electronics.

Components:
Arduino (Uno or any similar board)

Sound Sensor: Detects sound levels and sends a signal to the Arduino.

LED: The LED that will turn on or off based on the sound detected.

220 Ohm Resistor: Limits the current going through the LED to prevent damage.

Jumper Wires: Used to make the necessary connections between the components.

How It Works:
The sound sensor detects a clap (or any loud sound) and sends a signal to the Arduino.

The Arduino processes the input and turns the LED on or off based on the sound detected.

The LED stays on for 1 second after detecting a clap and then turns off.

Learnings:
Arduino programming for basic sensor input and output.

Understanding of sound sensors and how they interact with microcontrollers.

Control of LEDs using external inputs.
