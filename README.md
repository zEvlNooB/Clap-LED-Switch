# LED Clap Switch

This project enables you to control an LED with a clap sound. It uses a sound sensor to detect the clap, and based on the detection, the Arduino controls the LED's state (on or off). It‚Äôs an interactive and fun way to demonstrate how sound can interact with electronics.

## Components:
- **Arduino** (Uno or similar board)
- **Sound Sensor**: Detects sound and sends a signal to the Arduino.
- **LED**: The light source that is turned on or off based on the detected sound.
- **220 Ohm Resistor**: Protects the LED by limiting the current.
- **Jumper Wires**: For connecting the components together.

## How It Works:
- The sound sensor detects a clap (or any loud sound) and sends a signal to the Arduino.
- The Arduino processes this signal and toggles the state of the LED (turns it on or off).
- The LED remains on for 1 second after detecting the clap, and then turns off automatically.

## Learnings:
- Programming Arduino to interact with sensors and outputs.
- Working with sound sensors and understanding how they detect external sounds.
- Controlling LEDs based on sensor input.
